# apache-commons-matrix

Implementation of [core.matrix](https://github.com/mikera/matrix-api) backed by [Apache Commons Math](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/) matrices.  Minor issue kept it from working.

2014: Matt Adereth said: "This was motivated by my need for some of the [fancy decompositions](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/apidocs/org/apache/commons/math3/linear/package-summary.html) that aren't yet provided by the other core.matrix implementations."

## Usage

Add the following to your project.clj:

```clojure
[apache-commons-matrix "0.3.0"]
```
